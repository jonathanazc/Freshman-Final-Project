            <header>What is League of Legends?</header>
            <p>League of Legends is a MMO-RPG game. It is a face-paced and competitive online game with blends of both Real-Time Strategy and RPG elements. There are two teams and only one team wins. Each team battles it out on multiple maps (3 maps) and
                multple game modes. Each player gets to choose a champion to play in the game to duke it out. Champions are playable characters in the game, each with their own unique abilities and playstyle. Each game of League of Legends is unique because
                of the ever expanding roster of items, champions, and patches into the game. League of Legends also has a thriving ceompetitive scene in Esports. League of Legends offers endless fun and gameplay. Come join us, Summoner!</p>

            <header class="rift"><a href="rift.htm">Summoner's Rift</a></header>
            <p>Summoner's Rift is the main map of League of Legends and is the main part of the game. This is the map that the game usually shows in its advertisements. Two teams of five fight each other until one claims victory by destroying the enemy team's
                nexus, their base.</p>

            <HEADER class="aram"><a href="aram.htm" Aram> Aram</a> </HEADER>
            <p>Aram is the second map that League of Legends provides. Unlike Summoner's Rift, Aram is where two teams duke each other out in one single lane. </p>

            <header class="twisted"> <a href="twisted.htm">Twisted Treeline</a></header>
            <p>Twisted Treeline is another map but less played because of the entirely different playstyle. In this type of game, there are two teams each with 3 players. Your main goal, destroy the enemy nexus</p>
