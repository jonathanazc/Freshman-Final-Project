# Freshman-Final-Project
Freshman Final Project on League of Legends (created an HTML website)
This website was a final project for my Web Programming class at the University of Pittsburgh at Bradford. We had used knowledge used from the class to create our own website.
The folders represent the classification of objects in league of legends such as ex: "champions" file only have champions from the game.
default.html is the main page of the website and should be opened up first.
